# Container Fundamentals Course

A hands-on course covering Docker and Kubernetes fundamentals, from "what is a container" to GitOps deployments.

---

## Course Overview

**Format:** 8 weeks × 3 hours each  
**Prerequisites:** Basic Linux command line, some Python experience  
**Environment:** GitHub Codespaces (recommended) or Rocky Linux 8 VM  

### What You'll Learn

| Phase | Weeks | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Containerization** | 1-3 | Build, run, and optimize Docker containers |
| **Orchestration** | 4-6 | Deploy to Kubernetes, networking, security |
| **Operations** | 7-8 | Helm, Kustomize, GitOps with ArgoCD |

### Outcomes

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

- Build production-quality container images
- Deploy applications to Kubernetes
- Implement networking and security policies
- Use Helm and Kustomize for configuration management
- Set up GitOps pipelines with ArgoCD

## Getting Started

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

1. Fork this repository
2. Click **Code** → **Codespaces** → **Create codespace on main**
3. Wait for setup to complete (~2-3 minutes)
4. Verify: `docker run hello-world`

### Option 2: Local VM

See [Week 1 Installation Guide](./week-01/INSTALL-DOCKER.md) for Docker CE setup on Rocky Linux 8.

## Hands-On Practice

Each week includes:

- **Labs** - Guided exercises in the course content
- **Gym Exercises** - Practice scenarios in `container-gym/`

The gym uses "Jerry scenarios" - you fix broken infrastructure created by a well-meaning but chaotic teammate. This builds debugging skills through discovery.

## Assessment

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Gym Completions | 30% |
| Lab Participation | 20% |
| Discovery Questions | 10% |
| Capstone Project | 40% |
