  - Executive planning narrative (priorities, phases, metrics)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG_CKA_PLUS_PLATFORM.md`
  - Build-ready backlog with acceptance criteria
- `WEEK_BY_WEEK_BUILD_PLAN_6_WEEK.md`
  - Six-week delivery cadence and weekly exit criteria
- `CKA_MOCK_GRADING_RUBRIC.md`
  - Instructor scoring rubric for timed mock sprint grading

## Suggested Reading Order

1. `COURSE_PLANNING_CKA_PLUS_PLATFORM_2026Q1.md`
2. `IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG_CKA_PLUS_PLATFORM.md`
3. `WEEK_BY_WEEK_BUILD_PLAN_6_WEEK.md`

Then use the CKA matrix and execution queue docs for objective-level traceability and status tracking.
